# Prototypes

The prototypes of the game are above. Select [EXE](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/EXE) for Windows standalone (64-bit only), and [WebGL](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/WebGL) for WebGL (various browsers). Releases for MacOS are coming soon. Click the links for more information.

## Todo

- [x] Add MacOS support

## Notes

WebGL builds take a long time to build, so there aren't many of them. MacOS and Linux builds are coming, but only for full releases. This game is still in the prototype stage.
