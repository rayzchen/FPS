# Prototypes

The prototypes of the game are above. Select [EXE](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/EXE) for Windows standalone (64-bit only), and [WebGL](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/WebGL) for WebGL (various browsers). Releases for MacOS are coming soon. Click the links for more information.

## Todo
- [ ] Add Universal Windows standalone (coming soon!)
- [ ] Add MacOS support
- [ ] Add Android support
- [ ] Add iOS support

## Notes

WebGL builds take a long time to build, so there aren't many of them. I will stop with the 64-bit versions after I get UWin (Universal Windows) builds, only making them for big releases. After all, this is the prototype!
