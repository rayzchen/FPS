# Prototypes

The prototypes of the game are above. Select [Windows(64-bit)](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/Windows(64-bit)) for Windows standalone (64-bit only), [MacOS](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/MacOS) for Mac OS X, [Linux](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/Linux) for Linux x86_64 (64-bit) and [WebGL](https://github.com/rayzchen/FPS/tree/master/prototypes/WebGL) for WebGL (various browsers).

## Todo
- [x] Add MacOS support
- [ ] Add Universal Windows standalone
- [ ] Add Android support
- [ ] Add iOS support

## Notes

WebGL builds take a long time to build, so there aren't many of them. MacOS and Linux builds are coming, but only for full releases. This game is still in the prototype stage.
